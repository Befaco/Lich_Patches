# Wavenular Beta 1
Patch by Death Whistle <br/>
Dual wavetable oscillator based on audio input with vca, decay envelope and state variable filter.

- Button_1: Create new WaveForm
- Button_2: Gate in 
- Pot_A: Frequency Osc_1
- Pot_B: Frequency Osc_2
- Pot_C: Decay envelope (5sec)
- Pot_D: State variable filter (LP->HP)
....
- Gate Out: Pass through of Gate in
- CV_OUT_1: Frequecy Osc_1 (patch to cvB and sync the freq of the two osc)
- CV_OUT_2: Implement the envelope of Pot_C
	
ToDo:
- Implement Midi
- Improve Frequency tracking
- Improve Filters, add resonance
- Implement Gate Out and 2 CV OUT (Maybe 1 for the envelope out)
- Implement Several osc and wavetables to charge randomly if there is nothing in the input
