# Wavenular Beta 1
Patch by Death Whistle
Dual wavetable oscillator based on audio input with vca, decay envelope and state variable filter from LP to HP


ToDo:
1-Implement Midi 
2-Improve Frequency tracking
3-Improve Filters, add resonance (Hpf make click in the middle)
4-Implement Gate Out and 2 CV OUT (Maybe 1 for the envelope out)
5-Implement Several osc and wavetables to charge randomly if there is nothing in the input
