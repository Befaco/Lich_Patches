# Wavenular Beta 1
Patch by Death Whistle
Dual wavetable oscillator based on audio input with vca, decay envelope and state variable filter from LP to HP	
	
ToDo:
- Implement Midi 
- Improve Frequency tracking
- Improve Filters, add resonance (Hpf make click in the middle)
- Implement Gate Out and 2 CV OUT (Maybe 1 for the envelope out)
- Implement Several osc and wavetables to charge randomly if there is nothing in the input
