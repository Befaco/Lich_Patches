# Melsputter Beta 1
Patch by Death Whistle <br/>
Dual melody sputter synced to an external clock and quantized to several scales.

- Button_1: Clock in / tap Tempo
- Button_2: Stop the Clock (Momentary)
- Pot_A: Probability bass
- Pot_B: Probability lead
- Pot_C: Select Scale
- Pot_D: Low Pass Filter
....
- Gate Out: Pass through of Gate in (clock)
- CV_OUT_1: LowRandomLFO (Based on Pot_A probability)
- CV_OUT_2: HighRandomLFO (Based on Pot_B probability)

ToDo:
- Improve the internal synth (Add midi control)
